            <p class="lead">Before Git there was only the Lineux terminal. Lineux terminal had a partner in crime called the Bitkeeper. They worked together and were getting the job done until they split in 2005. The community that developed Lineux and the company that created Bitkeeper came to an end and they ended up parting ways. This break up caused Lineux to start developing new tool that Bitkeeper used to provide. These goals of these new tools were higher speeds, simple design, strong support for complex development, fully distributed, and the ability to handle large projects.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS stands for Version Control System. VCS' main job is to be a central main repository for all project files. When it comes to businesses, co-workers can check out files, alter them, then check them back in. As people check files out and in, theres a ledger of all the changes. VCS keeps track of who changed the file, when there were changes and what was changed. Some benefits are that files cannot be overwritten, theres a common repository, people can work on the same files simultaniously, and there is an automatic back up system.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Imagine how frustrating it would be if people had to work on the same project and only one person could work at a time. Everytime it was your turn to work, you would get a completely different project than what you started with. You also wouldn't know who changed what so a lot of questions you have would go unanswered. Luckily, workers can work at the same time, have a ledger of changes, keep their original projects, and the work is always in a central depository. We can do all of this because of the VCS system in Git. As I explained in the previous paragraph about the specfic things VCS does, this makes working as a team so much easier. </p>

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three basic steps are 'add', 'commit', and 'push'. The add command is where you add the working copy to the staging area (cache or index). Think of this staging area as a shopping cart. The files are sitting in there waiting to be told where to go next. This process is called commit. This is where you give the file its desiginated local depository. After this, you can push the files to a remote depository. If you wanted to pull a file from the remote depository, you would have to pull the file. To do this, you would have to fetch and merge the file and work backwards. You fetch the file from the remote to the local depository, then you merge it back into the working copy.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In this lesson, I learned how files are stored and used in a depository. I have worked in multiple offices and the only thing I have seen are physical paper files. I always wondered how programmers would organize and distribute their files. I was also always wondering if you had to email your code to get feedback but Git makes it so much more simple than that. I never thought people could work at the same time, keep a ledger of the changes and who changed it, and your files are never overwritten. In my opinion, Git must make working in an office much more hassle free.</p>
