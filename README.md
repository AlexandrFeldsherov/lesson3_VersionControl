## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned about Git and how it started off as a partnership between Lineux and Bitkeeper.
2. (VCS is the most important aspect of Git. VCS allows everyone for everyone to be able to work on projects at the same time. It also acts as a main depository for all files which makes everything more organized)
3. There are three steps to get your working project into the remote depository. Step one: Add, Step two: commit, step three: push.
